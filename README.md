- 👋 Hi, I’m @hoggy-perth - a grumpy old retired git who used to be in IT 
- 👀 I’m interested in Maths, Stats and Programming (kinda)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything 
- 📫 If for whatever reason you want to contact me do so at hogg_dave@yahoo.com.au
- can't imagine why you would bother ;-)
